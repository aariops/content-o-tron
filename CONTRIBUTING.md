# Contributing to the Content-o-Tron Project

Welcome to the project repository, and thank you for offering to contribute!

The purpose of this document is to illustrate the ways you can help the project out.

If you've never used GitHub before, we plan to include links to helpful documents to get you started. If you get stuck, join us for our fortnightly meetings. The details can be found in the [agenda][link_agenda].

## Participation guidelines

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.MD). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How to find tasks?

Tasks can be found in the `Issues` tab of the project repository.

All tasks that are open for contributions are labelled with [![help_wanted](https://img.shields.io/badge/-help_wanted-008672.svg)][link_help_wanted].

If this is your first time contributing to an open source project, then a gentle introduction can be found in tasks labelled [![good_first_issue](https://img.shields.io/badge/-good%20first%20issue-7057ff.svg)][link_good_first_issue]. If you need help, just ask and we'll mentor you.

## To code, or not to code

Non-code contributions are very important to us and you can find those tasks labelled [![no_code](https://img.shields.io/badge/-no%20code-fbca04.svg)][link_no_code].

On the other hand if code's your thing you'll want to check out [![code](https://img.shields.io/badge/-code-5e9ced.svg)][link_code].

## Short on time?

If you don't have time to pick a task, then maybe you can provide some input or feedback on the tasks labelled [![discuss](https://img.shields.io/badge/-discuss-ffc6e2.svg)][link_discuss].
