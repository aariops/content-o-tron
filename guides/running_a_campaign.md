- Pick a [focus topic][link_focus_topics] and write a summary of what you would like the campaign to cover.

## Time line

- Initiation
  - Write an introductory blog post on the relevant blog sites i.e. community.rs, blog.rust-lang.org, etc
  - Raise a tracking [issue][link_tracking_issue] for the campaign.
- Review cycle
  - Provide editorial assistance.
  - Identify any posts that could be passed onto blog.rust-lang.org or Mozilla Hacks, discuss with author.
- Curation
  - Gather all blog posts into an RSS feed and submit to [readrust.net][link_readrust]
  - Write up a summary/follow post on relevant blog sites i.e. community.rs, blog.rust-lang.org, etc
- Retrospective
