## What are we doing? (And why are we doing it?)

In it's simplist form what we are trying to do with the project is to formalise the process of generating topic related blog posts, whilst using a methodical way to gain repeat contributions.

Writing technical articles can sometimes feel daunting, often an author will wait until they have spent a considerable time learning Rust before even considering sharing their experience. 

Even then the act of sharing will be done verbally with friends or as part of a meetup. This unique insight isn't being shared with the wider Rust community.

Another reason that prevents these prospective authors from writing is the thought someone else will do it better than they could ever hope to achieve.
